* El Gantt – A Gantt Chart system for Orgmode files

El Gantt creates a Gantt calendar from your orgmode files. It provides a flexible customization system with the goal of being adaptable to multiple purposes. 
** Installation
 If you don't know how to install this:
1. Install all dependencies
- org-ql
- ts
- s
- dash
2. Clone this repository into your =lisp= directory (if you are using Emacs 27, you made need to swap =~/.emacs.d= with =~/.config/emacs=):
#+begin_src shell :results silent 
cd ~/.emacs.d/lisp
git clone httpqs://github.com/legalnonsense/elgantt.git
#+end_src
3. Then make sure the folder is in your load path:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/elgantt/")
#+end_src
4. Finally:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(require 'elgantt)
#+end_src
** First use
Run =(elg-open)=. By default, Elgantt will use your org-agenda files. 
*** Using the test file
Set =elg-agenda-files= to the location wherever you installed =elgantt/TEST/test.org=. If you cloned to the =/lisp/= subdirectory, then:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq elg-agenda-files (concat user-emacs-directory "lisp/elgantt/TEST/test.org"))
#+end_src
*** Setting the header type
The headers of the calendar are defined by =elg-header-type=. There are four default values and an option to define a custom function which will be run at the first point of each org heading:
| Value    | Behavior                                                                                  |
|----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| parent   | Group entries by parent heading                                                           |
| root     | Group entries under their root heading                                                    |
| category | Group entries by their CATEGORY property, or the filename if no CATEGORY property is set. |
| hashtag  | Group entries by tags which are prefixed by a hashtag.                                    |
| function | Run the given function at point, grouping entries by the return value of the function     |
*** Setting the timestamps to display
Customize the variable =elg-timestamps-to-display=. This variable is a list which can contain any of:
- deadline
- timestamp
- timestamp-ia
- scheduled
- timestamp-range
- timestamp-range-ia
The order of the list matters determined precedence. Only the first type of entry found in a heading will be displayed. 
** Using the calendar
| Key binding | 
*** Scrolling
Scroll to the left or right with "F" or "B" (that is, =S-f= and =S-b=). 
*** Navigating to the org file
Press =space= to navigate to the original org heading. 
*** Multiple entries
If a calendar cell has multiple entries, a special character will be displayed ("☰" by default). If you try to perform any function on one of these cells (e.g., navigating to the org file; shifting a date), you will be prompted to select the entry you want to perform the operation on. 
*** Moving dates
=M-f= and =M-b= will shift the date at point forward or backward by one day.
**** TODO insert note about org-ql caching. 
*** Drawing gradients
** Custom variables
| Variable                                   | Default                                                                         |

** Customization macros
ELG aims to provide a flexible approach to customizing calendar displays. 
*** Macros
The aim is to provide a robust interface to customize one’s calendar. 
**** Display macro
***** Basic use
***** Examples
****** the display-char function
****** color coding entries by TODO state
**** Commands macro
***** Example: marking a tast as done 
*** Helper functions
**** Drawing the display
***** Creating overlays
***** Creating gradients
***** Creating progress bars
**** Navigating the buffer

***** moving forward/backward
**** Selecting from multiple entries
**** Getting calendar data 
***** elg-get-date-at-point
***** elg-get-prop-at-point
**** Editing the underlying org file
Use the macro stolen from org-mode: =elg-with-point-at-orig-entry=
**** Redrawing 
***** Reloading the date at point
***** Reloading the entire buffer
***** Reloading displays
**** Miscellaneous utilities
***** Date calculator
** Experimental - Interaction macro 
** Example set up
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
