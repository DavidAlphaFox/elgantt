* El Gantt – A Gantt Chart system for Orgmode files

[[file:screenshots/8.png]]

El Gantt creates a Gantt calendar from your orgmode files. Block entries into the calendar are set using tags, and rows are designated by either categories or tags. 
** DANGER!!

I am not a programmer, nor do I pretend to be one. This is designed to be a PROTOTYPE. It is guaranteed that you will encounter errors and problems trying to use this package. I have written this to the point where it works for me, and I know the quirks that cause problems enough to avoid them. 

The code you will encounter is /awful/. I learned elisp /while/ writing this package. I worked in very short bursts while doing my real job (lawyer). If it seemed to work, I used it. 

I do not have time to work on this! I am hoping this will inspire someone to re-write this from scratch. 
 
This /should/ work with the ~sample.org~ file that is in the TEST directory. To use it, you’ll have change line 180 so that ~org-map-entries~ points to the sample file rather than using your ~agenda~ files. 

When I say I learned elisp while writing this, I mean that literally. I did not know anything, and so this is 100% amateur hackery. 

** How to use

This system operatese on tags /or/ categories. 

*** Using categories (default)

The default to use categories, which are set in a property drawer. This approach works best if your org file is heirarchical. For example 

#+begin_src org :tangle yes
* Justin 
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Justin
:END:
** TODO Cut the grass
<2019-01-10 Thu>
** TODO mow the lawn
<2019-02-12 Tue>
** TODO submit TPS reports
DEADLINE: <2019-04-02 Tue>
#+end_src

In this example, all three tasks would be displayed in a row labeled “Justin,” since the CATEGORY property is inherited.

To add another row, start a new category:

#+begin_src org 
* Juanita
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Juanita
:END:
** TODO sharpen knives
<2019-07-25 Thu>
** TODO submit thesis for intial review
DEADLINE: <2019-09-08 Sun>
#+end_src

This will produce the following:

*** Using hashtags instead of Categories

You can also use hashtags. To to this, set ~elgantt/use-hashtag~ to non-nil. A tag that starts with a ~#~ will substitute for the category. 

The benefit of hashtags is that your file need not be  hierarchical. For example, the following will pick up the ~take out the garbage~ task, and put it on the proper line for Justinia. (Note the take that is marked on July 30.)

#+begin_src org
* Justin :#Justinia:
** TODO Cut the grass
<2019-01-10 Thu>
** TODO mow the lawn
<2019-02-12 Tue>
** TODO submit TPS reports
DEADLINE: <2019-04-02 Tue>
* Juanita :#Juanitan:
** TODO sharpen knives
<2019-07-25 Thu>
** TODO submit thesis for intial review
DEADLINE: <2019-09-08 Sun>
* An unrelated heading
** TODO take out the garbage :#Justinia:
<2019-07-30 Tue>
#+end_src

** Displaying blocks of time

There are two ways to display a block of time
*** Use tags with ~x_start~ and ~x_end~, where ~x~ is an arbitrary string. 

When using this method, the text of the heading of the ~start~ tag is irrelevant. 

#+begin_src org  
* Justin 
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Justin
:END:
** TODO Cut the grass
<2019-01-10 Thu>
** TODO mow the lawn
<2019-02-12 Tue>
** start TPS reports :TPS_start:
<2019-02-19 Tue>
** TODO submit TPS reports :TPS_end:
DEADLINE: <2019-04-02 Tue>
#+end_src 

[[file:screenshots/5.png]]
*** Using time ranges and the tag ~x_block~ and using an active time range

You can also designate a block of time by adding a time range and using the ~_block~ tag:
#+begin_src org 
* Justin 
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Justin
:END:
** TODO Cut the grass
<2019-01-10 Thu>
** TODO mow the lawn
<2019-02-12 Tue>
** start TPS reports :TPS_start:
<2019-02-19 Tue>
** TODO submit TPS reports :TPS_end:
DEADLINE: <2019-04-02 Tue>
* Juanita
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Juanita
:END:
** out of town :vacation_block:
<2019-03-01 Fri>--<2019-04-30 Tue>
** TODO sharpen knives
<2019-07-25 Thu>
** TODO submit thesis for intial review
DEADLINE: <2019-09-08 Sun>
#+end_src

** Echo area

The echo area will display the name of the heading, and the headline text at the point. For example, in the above calendar if the point was on Justin and April 2, the echo area shows:

** Navigation
Usual emacs keybindings, except:
| Key    | Command                           |
|--------+-----------------------------------|
| space  | Jump to point in org file         |
| Return | Open agenda for the date at point |
| b, f   | Jump to next entry on line        |
** Other features

I am pretty sure there are other features, but I have forgotten them due to the lag between when I stopped working on this and when I uploaded it.
