** how to use

This system operatese on tags /or/ categories. 

*** Using categories (default)

The default to use categories, which are set in a property drawer. This approach works best if your org file is heirarchical. For example 

#+begin_src org :tangle yes
* Justin
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Justin
:END:
** TODO take out the garbage
<2019-08-19 Mon>
** TODO finish final report
DEADLINE: <2019-08-30 Fri>
#+end_src

In this example, both tasks would be displayed in a row labeled “Justin,” since the CATEGORY property is inherited. To add another row, start a new category. 

#+begin_src org :tangle yes
* Juanita
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Juanita
:END:
** TODO sharpen knives
<2019-07-25 Thu 10:00>
** TODO submit thesis for intial review
DEADLINE: <2019-09-08 Sun>
#+end_src

This will produce the following chart:



To set a tag as a header (i.e., create a named row of the calendar), prefix it with a hashtag. So if a heading has the tag “#Jones”, it will create a heading for Jones and display all tasks that have that same hashtag (or that inherit that tag).

The calendar will then create an entry for (you have the following options):
1. all active timestamps (including deadlines), or
2. all deadlines

To create a highlighted block of time, you can:

NOT SUPPORTED 1. create a time range with an active timestamp (assuming that you’ve enabled elgantt/config/show-active-timestamps)

2. place two tags in headings with deadlines in the form xxx_start and xxx_end

If there is a _start but no _end, then the tag will be ignored but El Gantt will warn you in the echo area

If the latter, then that block on the calendar will be named “xxxx”

To designate a time range as tentative, add the tag #tentative. This will cause the timeblock to be colored in a lighter color than the one you’ve selected 

El Gantt will try to make your calendar look beautiful by using gradients other effects. 

Each tag “xxxx_start” will be assigned a color. You can configure this by customizing the variable elgantt/variables/tag-colors, which will be a plist in the form of (“tag-name” color . . .).
If that variable is nil, it will arbitrarily select colors and update the tag-colors variable as it selects a new color. 

If there are overlapping time stamps, then there will be a very nice gradient effect showing both. If three things overlap, I do not know what will happen. 

** viewing your life 
From the Gantt Chart, you can quickly:
navigate immediately to your agenda on a given day (enter)
navigate to calfw for a given month (c)
naviate to org file at point in calendar (space)

** navigating the calendar is intuitive

n, p (next line, previous line)
b, f (next entry, previous entry)
a, e (begin line, end line)
B, F (next day, previous day)
j (jump to date)
r (reload)
